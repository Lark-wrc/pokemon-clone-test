?: "Wake up Brendan, You've got to get going!"
You hear you're mom's voice from the custom alarm clock she got you. @It's annoying, but she made it just for you, so you still use it. @You begrudgingly wake up, turning on the tv and starting your morning routine.

Tv: "Good morning Hoenn, This is your host, Ted Cartvin. Today marks the @7th anniversery since the day Kyogre nearly flooded the planet. @Though pokemon created disasters seem to be all the rage these days, that day @was still one of the more tragdic, and we honor those who were injured @in the flooding."
Tv: "We also give our thanks yet again to the young miss who saved our bacon @that day, so to speak! Miss May Millar! @It's been quite a while since we've last seen her in a tornement, @but i'm positive she's out doing something impressive even now."
Tv: "Now, for the weather!"

It's been a while since they did a story on May. Your best friend is indeed the same May, @something that still astounds you a bit everytime you see her. @You remember when the two of you were @roaming the country side, catching pokemon and having adventures. 
Of course, after the incident 4 years ago, May has sworn off pokemon training. @Not pokemon, she could never be seperated from her team, who she's been @through, well, saving the world with. She won't battle anymore though. It hurts you @to remember how  torn up she was after that day. However, @it brings a smile to your groggy face when you @remember giving up your petty childhood rivalry @to help her out back then.

Now a days, you spend all you're time together. Since she decided to go back to @school, to get that high school diploma so many trainers end up @skipping out on for battle practice, you went with her. @Going to Manville for the best school on the continent, you ended @up sharing a condo with her. You chuckle when @you remember how shocked you were when Dad and her mother told you about it. @'You two are like brother and sister anyway, and it'll help @the expenses. What's got you so worked up?' Dad had said.
cmd@wait
You put the awkward memory of avoiding your Dad's @questions after that out of your head. You've already finished getting dressed, and @breakfast isn't going to cook itself.

You start cooking breakfast. As you do, your mind wanders back to the incident you glazed over earlier. May had been in slateport, helping out some friends in the shipyard with her Swampert. As she was leaving, an ex member of Team Aqua, which May singlehandedly shut own when you were kids, came out of the crowd.

The guy tried to kill May. He ran at her with a knife. Her Minun, which happened to be out of it's pokeball at the time, jumped out. She was 14 at the time. Min... didn't survive. May was torn apart. You had came home yourself after the incident, to be with your best friend. After a while, she got better, but she wasn't the same. She stopped travelling, drastically avoided the press, and gave up battling. She started up high school in Manville, and you stuck with her.
cmd@wait
You realize you'll burn your toast if you keep up this flashback thing your doing. You decided to get back to making toast for you and May. You already forgot your pokeballs your desk, and didn't see if May was up.
